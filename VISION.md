# Vision
Godocit is a personal project. From our current viewpoint, its role is:
Provide an automatic flow for keeping track of documentation.

Our detailed items:
  * Works easily by just adding a "documentation needed" label on the PR
* Create issues on different repositories

## Core Concept
Godocit's core concept is to provide an automatic tool to never miss documentation for new features.

## General Aim
Godocit provides an easy and fast way to create documentation issues for new features and keep track of undocumented features

## Communication
A lot of discussion about Godocit happens within Github issues. Ideally, we will keep it that way until Godocit becomes big enough that this turns into a problem. The advantages of this is that all documentation and issues are publicly searchable and easily linked to the source code.

## Contributions
The Godocit project should always aim to devote a lot of time to making contributors feel like an important part of the community. We should strive to provide a place for anyone to be able to contribute. The aim of the core team should be to work on ways to showcase contributions, encourage adoption and show off great work. An example of where this worked is the [CocoaPods Quality Index](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods.org-Two-point-Five/).
